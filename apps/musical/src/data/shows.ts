      "Kander and Ebb's 1975 vaudeville about murder as a career move, and the longest-running American musical on Broadway.",
    summary:
      "Chicago The Musical, everywhere it plays: Broadway without a closing date, Tokyo, Osaka and Dubai in 2026, and thirty-three British and Irish theatres in 2027 — with the venue, the dates and the seller for each.",
    hook: [
      "Chicago failed first. It opened in June 1975, ran 936 performances, spent its whole life in the shadow of A Chorus Line, and closed. The revival that resurrected it twenty-one years later was a concert staging with no set, no costumes to speak of and the band pushed on stage because there was nowhere else to put them \u2014 and that cheap idea is the version now playing its fourth decade at the Ambassador Theatre.",
      "It is the longest-running American musical in Broadway history and the second-longest-running show of any kind, past 11,000 performances and still selling. This year it also plays Tokyo, Osaka and Dubai; next year, thirty-three theatres across Britain and Ireland.",
      "Below is every run this site tracks \u2014 the theatre, the dates and whoever is actually selling the tickets \u2014 plus what the show is, how it got here, and the numbers you can watch tonight for nothing.",

        body: [
          "Almost every musical opens by telling you where you are. Chicago opens by telling you what it wants from you: Velma Kelly walks out alone, invites the audience to a night of \u201cmusic and dancin\u2019 and all that jazz\u201d, and performs an entire number without mentioning that she has just killed two people.",
          "Watch what runs underneath it. While Velma holds the front of the stage, Roxie Hart shoots her lover on the other side of it \u2014 the show\u2019s whole argument delivered before anyone has said a line: the crime is the small part, the performance is the career.",
          "The number belongs to Fred Ebb\u2019s lyric and John Kander\u2019s vamp, and to the Fosse vocabulary that arrives with it \u2014 turned-in knees, angled shoulders, the hat doing the work a face would do anywhere else.",

          "That look is not a budget. It is what survived from the 1996 concert staging at City Center, which had no money for a set, worked better without one, and became the version that has now outlived every fully dressed production the show ever had.",
          "It is also the fairest preview of what a ticket buys. If you are trying to picture the evening in Dubai, Tokyo or Manchester, picture this \u2014 a band, a bare stage and thirteen dancers, in a theatre.",

A courtroom run as entertainment, a defendant coached into a sympathetic character, a press pack rewarded for the version that sells \u2014 the show has been called prophetic often enough that Kander and Ebb had to keep denying they were predicting anything.",
          "Sung here by James Naughton, who won a Tony for the part in 1997. The performance is deliberately unhurried: Flynn is never in a rush, because he already knows how it ends.",

          "Music by John Kander, lyrics by Fred Ebb, book by Ebb and Bob Fosse, from Maurine Dallas Watkins's 1926 play. Roxie wants to be famous, Velma was famous first, Billy Flynn sells acquittals at a flat rate, and the press is the third party in every scene.",
          "The staging is deliberately bare: the band sits on stage in full view, the numbers are announced like vaudeville turns, and the dancing is Fosse — angled hips, turned-in knees, a hat, a held pause. That look started as a budget decision at a 1996 concert staging and has outlived every set the show ever had.",
          "If you know one number it is \"All That Jazz\". The others people leave humming are \"Cell Block Tango\" and \"Razzle Dazzle\". It is a satire about celebrity and crime, played for laughs and sex rather than sentiment, and it is billed for teenagers upwards rather than for small children — the venue for your run publishes the age guidance.",
